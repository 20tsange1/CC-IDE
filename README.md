# Final Year Project

A Computable Contract IDE, designed for drafting contracts.

In order to begin using the IDE and install tree-sitter, follow the steps below:

1. Open Terminal
2. Navigate to folder
3. Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run `python3 app.py`
5. Open up `http://localhost:8080/` in a web browser.

In the case that tree-sitter needs to be installed and configured, you will need to initialise tree-sitter.
This can be done via the steps below:

1. Run `npm install -g tree-sitter-cli`
2. `cd cola`
3. `tree-sitter init-config`
4. `tree-sitter init`

Current flow of operations:

1. BNF of Grammar written in a text file.
2. BNF is then parsed and evaluated into a Tree-Sitter grammar json file.
3. Tree-Sitter is then used to convert this into a parser
4. We build the language on Python and are now able to parse using this language + traverse our parse trees.
5. The front-end application is hosted on Flask, establishing a web-server.
6. All auxiliary functionality operate on the AST generated by tree-sitter, leveraging a plugin-style structure for extensibility.

Current Implemented Features:

- Autosuggestion
- Syntax Highlighting
- BNF Parsing
- File saving + editing
- Incremental Parsing
- Different AST View Modes (Tree, Hierarchical)
- Condition and Event Evaluation


A key benefit currently provided by this application is our ability to use grammars as we develop them (although there are considerations still to be solved regarding associativity, precedence and so forth), making it versatile towards all current legal grammars with a valid BNF.
